To open project, please navigate yourself to 2_backend directory and run script "npm run nodemon", it will start a server witch is on 5000 port.

Now we can start our react app. Navigate to 1_frontend directory and run "npm start", page will open automaticaly in your browser. Enjoy :)

As a admin, in our project you can Create, Update, Delete and View all of our Users. All data is stored im MongoDB, details I will send you privately. Our front page sends request to our backend, expecting some specific data back. With node.js and express.js we can easily complete this task in no time.
